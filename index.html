                <strong>Hacking the box office</strong>
                <p>
                    The project explores the influence of demographic data of the cast, such as ethnicity, gender, age, and star power, on the global box office of movies. Results show that movies with more diverse casts tend to make lower profits than those with mostly white casts, and that actors have a higher presence in movies than actresses.
